# TasteLens 🍽️ : Your Taste, Our Lens ✨

---

## ✨ Overview

TasteLens is a personalized food recommendation system that suggests food items based on individual preferences. The system leverages multiple machine learning models to analyze user behavior and item characteristics, enabling more accurate and diverse recommendations.

The project explores different recommendation strategies and combines them to improve personalization and recommendation quality.

A **web interface** was built to display recommendations, allowing users to **browse popular dishes** and see **personalized suggestions** generated by the ML models.

---

## ⚠️ Problem Statement

- Food platforms offer a wide range of choices, making it difficult for users to find dishes that match their personal preferences.  
- Most recommendation systems rely on generic or popularity-based suggestions, which fail to capture individual tastes.  
- Personalized food recommendation is challenging due to subjective user preferences and the lack of suitable, real-world food preference datasets.  
- Using a single recommendation approach often results in biased or less accurate suggestions.  

**TasteLens** aims to address these challenges by applying multiple machine learning–based recommendation models and combining them through a hybrid approach to deliver more relevant and personalized food recommendations.

---

## ⚙️ Methodology

TasteLens follows a **multi-model recommendation approach** to deliver personalized food suggestions. Different recommendation techniques capture unique aspects of user behavior, and combining them improves overall recommendation quality.

### 1. Content-Based Filtering
- Recommends food items by analyzing item attributes and user preferences.
- Builds a preference profile for each user based on past interactions.
- Suggests food items with similar characteristics.
- **Advantages:** Effective personalization even when user interaction data is limited.

### 2. User-Based Collaborative Filtering (UBCF)
- Identifies users with similar taste patterns by comparing their rating behavior.
- Recommends items liked by similar users to the target user.
- **Advantages:** Introduces variety beyond a single user’s history by leveraging shared preferences.

### 3. Item-Based Collaborative Filtering (IBCF)
- Focuses on relationships between food items rather than users.
- Items receiving similar ratings from multiple users are considered related.
- When a user interacts with a food item, similar items are recommended.
- **Advantages:** Stable and efficient recommendation generation.

### 4. Hybrid Recommendation Model
- Combines content-based filtering with collaborative filtering techniques.
- Aggregates recommendations from individual models to produce the final output.
- **Advantages:** Reduces over-specialization, improves recommendation diversity, and provides balanced results compared to using a single model.

## 🔄 System Architecture

TasteLens is designed as a **modular recommendation system**, where each component transforms user preference data into meaningful food recommendations. The architecture supports multiple recommendation models and allows their outputs to be combined in a structured manner.

### Architecture Overview
The system processes user–food interaction data through a sequence of well-defined stages, ensuring accuracy, scalability, and clarity in recommendation generation.

### Workflow Description

1. **User Preference Data Input**
   - Accepts user interaction data including user IDs, food item IDs, ratings, and basic item attributes.
   - This data represents individual taste patterns and serves as the foundation for personalization.

2. **Data Preprocessing and Preparation**
   - Cleans and standardizes raw data for consistency across models.
   - Handles missing values, normalizes ratings, and transforms data into model-compatible formats.

3. **Independent Model Training**
   - Each recommendation model (Content-Based, User-Based CF, Item-Based CF) is trained independently.
   - Each model captures unique aspects of user behavior and item similarity.

4. **Model-Specific Recommendation Generation**
   - Trained models generate individual recommendation lists based on their methodology.
   - Each list reflects a different perspective on user preference and similarity.

5. **Hybrid Recommendation Integration**
   - Aggregates recommendations from all models using a hybrid strategy.
   - Balances personalization and diversity while reducing bias from any single model.

6. **Final Recommendation Output**
   - Integrated recommendation list is presented as the final output.
   - Delivers personalized and relevant food suggestions to users.

## 🛠️ Feature Engineering & Preprocessing

The TasteLens dataset was preprocessed and transformed to extract meaningful features for all four recommendation models: Content-Based, User-Based Collaborative Filtering (UBCF), Item-Based Collaborative Filtering (IBCF), and Hybrid. The goal was to ensure that each model could effectively capture user preferences and item similarities.

### 1. Content-Based Filtering

- **Feature Combination**: Multiple text-based features were combined into a single representation with weighted importance:

```bash
combined = cuisine (2x) + diet_type (1.5x) + course + ingredients + goals
```

- **Missing Values**: Filled any missing values in the **combined text column** with empty strings.
- **Vectorization**: Used **`TfidfVectorizer`** to convert textual features into **numerical vectors**.
- **Similarity Calculation**: Computed **cosine similarity** between dishes to identify **similar items** for each user.

<br>

### 2. Item-Based Collaborative Filtering (IBCF)

- **Relevant Columns**: Extracted `user_id`, `dish_name`, and `rating`.
- **Data Cleaning**: Converted **ratings** to numeric and dropped rows with **missing values**.
- **Index Mapping**: Created **numeric mappings** for users and items to build a **sparse user-item matrix**.
- **Similarity Computation**: Applied **cosine similarity** on the **transposed matrix (items × users)** to measure **item-item similarity**.

<br>

### 3. User-Based Collaborative Filtering (UBCF)

- **User-Item Matrix**: Rows = `user_id`, Columns = `dish_name`, Values = `rating`.
- **Missing Values**: Handled appropriately to ensure **matrix completeness**.
- **Similarity Computation**: Applied **cosine similarity** on the **user-item matrix** to identify **similar users**.
- **Evaluation**: Split dataset into **train and test sets** to assess **model performance**.

<br>

### 4. Hybrid Recommendation Model

- **Approach**: Combined **explicit collaborative filtering (SVD-based)** with **content-based similarity features**.
- **Text Features**: Concatenated `dish_name`, `cuisine`, and `restaurant_name` and vectorized using **TF-IDF**.
- **Similarity Calculation**: Computed **cosine similarity** for **content-based features**.
- **SVD Collaborative Filtering**: Trained model on **user-food ratings** using the **`surprise` library**.
- **Final Recommendations**: Aggregated predictions from **both approaches** to generate **robust recommendations**.

<br>

## Key Insights

- **Preprocessing** ensured all models received **clean, structured, and meaningful input**.
- Transformed **text features, numerical ratings, and user interactions** into **model-compatible formats**.
- **Cosine similarity** and **matrix factorization (SVD)** formed the backbone of the **recommendation calculations**.
